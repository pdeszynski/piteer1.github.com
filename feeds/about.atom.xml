&lt;p&gt;Yup that's me. Or at least there will be me. I'm waiting for some picture that can be used here. But who am I?
Yet another boring programmer, who loves sitting down nearby his computer and dive into different stuff. Sadly (or rather this is my big luck)
I have a wife which doesn't allow me to sit and work too much. So basically I'm always having problem with time. Right now I'm working in
company named &lt;em&gt;Red Sky&lt;/em&gt;. Don't know if you heard about it thought... maybe you heard about &lt;a href="http://www.filestube.com," title="Filestube"&gt;Filestube&lt;/a&gt;...
Still nothing?
I'm working here mostly on webdevel. Using PHP, Javascript, Python, C++ and sometimes Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that for some time this page might be empty (I'm not a person that likes to showoff with certs or smth). &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="about"></category></entry></feed>
